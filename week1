Day 1

vps, hetzner, droplet hyperscalers, droplets were introduced first by do in around 2013 ip, internet, intro to it infrastructure autoscaling, vertical scaling, horizontal scaling hyperscaling is like manual version automated for vps ip, user, ssh keys, black screen, linux, server management, web services, databases setup, connecting with db, cms connect with nginx ports ip ports, connecting to servers, linux team, provider apache nginx windows IIS debian, ubuntu vm -> vps -> managed cloud hosting docker concepts important terms: IaaS PaaS Software as a Service KINSTA we talked about systems administration role opsgenie vectorops single tier vs autonomous on cloudways monolthic code vs micro services

day2

learnt about slack and how to use it. history of IRC, DALNET, FREENODE

Learnt about channels, workspaces, threads, learnt about @ mentions and basic attiquates

reveiw:

cloudways

managed cloud hosting

VMs/VPS

PaaS/IaaS/SaaS

learnt about how wordpress and other cms like joomla and magento working and plugins, themes

stock/vanilla wordpress

SINGLE TIER, and how all services are on same tier and learnt about IP address

learn about multitier service, learnt about load balancer. vertical scaling and horizonal scaling, concept of self healing, docker swarm, kubernetes, supervisor on ubuntu

learnt about monitoring,

POP's, CDN(cloudflare)

learnt about DOS attack, CnC agent, botnets, need protection, so preffered cloudflare, excellent read cloudflare blogs. sync flooding, reflection attacks, cloud flare attacks.

Some of the concepts we explored today are:

PaaS/IaaS/SaaS
Content Delivery Networks (CDN)
DoS/DDoS (Denial of Service Attacks)
Horizontal server scaling vs Vertical server scaling
Single-tier and multi-tier architecture.
Pricing tiers and freemium models

____________________________________________________________________________

Day 3

expored cloudways pricing plans and feaures w.r.t to SSL and shared hosting, KINSTA, WP ENGINE

discussed about different hosting like shared, vps and host os, guest os. cleared different concepts about this.

TOS, SLA's

DMCA PIRACY COMPLAINS

IPV4, IPV6

learnt about server cedentials monitoringm manage services, settings and packages and other settings of web server

q: sepervisord

vendor lock in and explored DO, and explored the basic services

BYOD/S

learnt about different high level overview on how to it infrastructure works

and about a high level overview of mysql and nosql

linux manpage

linus torvals, history of linux and unix

ruby, ruby on rails, MVC

python

next:

linux, unix

Day 4

what we will cover today

unix and linux history

multiuser, time-sharing

job - set of instructions that computer run

invented by bell labs, same founders as ken thompson dennis richie from bell abs

c++ bjarn stoutrup

multics, c, assembly

multiuser, means at a time, more than one user can use

time-sharing is a concept that

berkeley university

HP-UX

IBM UNIX

DARWIN old version od macOS

OPENBSD, FREEBSD, NETBSD

ANDREW TANNEBRAUN, professor of finland helinsiki, MINIX. stripped down version. LINUS TORVALDS,

Concept: Kernel, applications

kernels, drivers, datasheet, ic, format of communicating with ic is given in datasheet, modules, kernels, device drivers

kernel allowsa access to the hardware, gives an interface to applications to access the cpu etc etc

each kernel has new features

file system, nfs, fat32, ext

concept: compiling kernel, sirf driver compile krein and make binary, make size compacts

kernel.org

linmodems website, modem software emulated

rootkit, systemcalls of kernels

richard stallman, RMS, free software foundation, source code modify, xerox printer driver. 4 basic freedoms, FSF organizations, GNU/LINUX, Gcc compilers, GDB debugger, GNU Emas,

linux was kernel and gnu was applications

GPL v2/v3

openlicenses

apache, MIT, BSD

creative commons

free software, open source

borland compiler

UNIX derived IBM, HP, SOLARIS, SUNOS, other is macOS

WSL

Powershell

systemcalls, are functions in C

interface is UI Interface, web ka interface, cli, c code interface, function c,

for example, c ki funcation call read () uses interface and brings the data

how rootkit can compromise the syscalls, rootkit hunters are used.

linux main point was cli, windows was UI based.

CLI interface is command interpreter

BASH, also called as BASH Shell

ASH

SH

ZASH

CSH

echo $SHELL
/bin/bash
explored the benefits of different shells such as BASH

explored about what scripting it is and how to execute it.

File System, ext264, ext4

concept about libraries

learnt about poising in commands such as ls

explored different file systems such as NTFS, ext, extFAT

learnt about linux distro's, linux kernels are same in every distro, more info kernel.org

GNU applications , apps set, GUI set all 3 combined are called make a distro

GNOME KDE

XFCE

Debian, redhat, SLS/Slackware

GENTOO

GNOME UI, KDE, BLACKBOX UI

ArchLinux

FreeBSD(its a unix)

FREENODE

Dualboot

virualbox

WSL

Docker ubuntu
