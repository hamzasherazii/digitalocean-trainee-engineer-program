Kernel

The kernel is the fundamental part of a Linux operating system. It acts as the bridge between the hardware (your computer's physical components) and the software applications you use.


GNU Core

Imagine your Linux system as a toolbox. The GNU core utilities are like the basic toolkit you'd find in almost any toolbox. These are the essential tools you need for everyday tasks.

X-Server

The X-Server in Linux is the invisible conductor behind the scenes of your graphical user interface (GUI). It's like a translator between your applications and your monitor, keyboard, and mouse.
