# Day 1

(( my personal progress))


Redhat is a major supplier of linux operating systems
They describe linux as composed of THREE major sections:
1. The Kernel
2. The System User Space
3. Applications


## KERNEL:
Kernel is the base of the operating system (( almost the lowest layer ))
Kernel manages the hardwar eand its interactions with everything else

When the computer "boots" up 
It either
- runs BIOS (Basic Input/Output System) or
- runs UEFI (Unified Extendable Firmware Interface)

These run a bootloader that loads the Kernal image

From here, the Kernel initializes and starts up everything else that is required to run (e.g., drivers and software)
