# Day 1

(( my personal progress))


Redhat is a major supplier of linux operating systems
They describe linux as composed of THREE major sections:
1. The Kernel
2. The System User Space
3. Applications

---

## KERNEL:
Kernel is the base of the operating system (( almost the lowest layer ))
Kernel manages the hardwar eand its interactions with everything else

When the computer "boots" up 
It either
- runs BIOS (Basic Input/Output System) or
- runs UEFI (Unified Extendable Firmware Interface)

These run a bootloader that loads the Kernal image

From here, the Kernel initializes and starts up everything else that is required to run (e.g., drivers and software)

---

## Administrative Layer (system user space)
This is an administrative layer for the tasks like configuration and software installation
- It includes shell or command interpreter
- Also includes daemons (Daemons run in the background to manage things)
  Daemons are not visible to the users cuz they don't allow interaction but they ARE vital for the proper functioning of Linux
---

## Software (Applications)
jo normal applications hoti hain e.g., browser

---

# Distributions 
Ek cheez ki different versions ko distributions keh skte hain
Decide krna konsi distribution best hai quite difficult hota hai or totally apki needs pe depend krta hai

---

Shurru k dino mai Linux itna khaas nhi tha jitna aaj hai
Uss mai boht se maslay thay jese
- Use krne mai difficult tha
- Install krne mai bhi difficult tha
- Lack of "drivers" for hardware
