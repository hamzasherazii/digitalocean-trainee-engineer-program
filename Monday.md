# Day 1

(( my personal progress))


Redhat is a major supplier of linux operating systems
They describe linux as composed of THREE major sections:
1. The Kernel
2. The System User Space
3. Applications


KERNEL:
Kernel is the base of the operating system (( almost the lowest layer ))
Kernel manages the hardwar eand its interactions with everything else

When the computer "boots" up 
The Kernel either
- runs BIOS (Basic Input/Output System)
- runs UEFI (Unified Extendable Firmware Interface)
